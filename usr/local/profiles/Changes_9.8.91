login-system:

   Only set LPS if not already set. Facilitates test versions.

   Move do.messages to top, so local motd follows global without a break.

   Move path setting up so cursor call works.


set.TERM:

   Make tset operate quietly

   stty intr susp quit dsusp to reasonable values

   stty erase to ^H for X-terminals, DEL for all others. if $deferase is
   set (ie in cshrc like defterm) this overrides.
