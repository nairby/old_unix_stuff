Structural changes:

For compatibility with pyramid .login, .cshrc files, which call 
login-system and cshrc-system, and expect these to do the newuser things as 
well:

*-system renamed to *-alluser
.login , .cshrc source to *-alluser rather than *-system
*-system source to *-alluser then *-newuser
ln -s *-alluser .*-system (compatibility)

Modifications should be made to *-alluser and *-newuser in future.


Content changes:

login-alluser:

  setenv TZ GMT0BST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0

  setenv MAILMACHINE ts  for spool mail delivery
  setenv MAILDROP, MAILBOX correctly for spool mail delivery
