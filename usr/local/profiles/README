How the dot files hang together.

.login , .cshrc:

  These are the template files which should be installed in the users'
home directory at registration time. These call login-alluser , login-newuser ;
cshrc-alluser , cshrc-newuser.  Users may remove the call to -newuser from
their copies of the files. Users may add their own customisation to their
copies.


login-alluser , cshrc-alluser:

  These perform session initialisation tasks which must be completed for the
satisfactory conduct of the user's session. These are called (sourced) from
the template .login and .cshrc files.


login-newuser , cshrc-newuser:

  These perform session and shell initialisations appropriate to naive users
of the system. They are called from the template .login and .cshrc files, but
users may remove the calls if they wish.


The above files constitute the core of the profile scheme. There are additional
files which are included in the directory for compatibility reasons:

login-system , cshrc-system:

  These are included for users migrating from the pyramid, who wish to continue
using their pyramid .login and .cshrc files. The pyramid dotfiles make a single
call to *-system, and expect the system and newuser initialisation to occur.
login-system , cshrc-system thus source to *-alluser and *-newuser.

.*-system:

  Some versions of the AIX dotfiles source to .*-system, when they mean 
*-alluser.  .*-system should be a link to *-alluser.

.*-newuser:
 
  Some versions of the AIX dotfiles source to .*-newuser when they mean
*-newuser. .*-newuser should be a link to *-newuser.
